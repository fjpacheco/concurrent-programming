# Concurrent Programming

Contents seen in the [subject](https://concurrentes-fiuba.github.io/) of Concurrent Programming taught at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires:

Classic concurrency models:
* Shared mutable state
* Fork-join parallelism
* Channels / Messages
* Asynchronous programming
* Actors

In addition, topics such as:
* Distributed Concurrency:
  * Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithms
  * Leader Election Algorithms
  * Transaction Algorithms 

In the subject, the **Rust programming** language is used, so all the code is written in this language.

## First Assignment Work

[[Statement](/assignment-1/README.md)] | [[Solution](/assignment-1/solution)]

First Assignment work of the subject in which the five previously seen concurrency models are used.

## Second Assignment Work

[[Statement](/assignment-2/README.md)] | [[Solution](/assignment-2/solution)]

Second Assignment work of the subject in which we work with the mentioned algorithms of distributed concurrency.
